              Destu Muktar is not just a name â€” she is a movement. A proud graduate of Hawassa University's
              AgroEconomics Department, Destu embodies the fusion of intellect, resilience, and purpose.

              discipline, but as a calling. Her academic path was marked by excellence, her leadership by compassion,
              and her vision by impact.

              She has championed sustainable agricultural practices, empowered rural communities, and inspired countless
              young women to dream beyond boundaries.
